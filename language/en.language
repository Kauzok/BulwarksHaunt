Some even believe that the birth of a new star is related to the leaving of the spirit of the deceased. Such heartwarming, wishful thinking in rough times.\r\n\r\nSome say that absolutely nothing happens, and that person is just... gone. Forever. And that's it. No spirits, no souls, no hope. A dreadful thought, isn't it?\r\n\r\nBut what is more dreadful is the idea of wandering spirits. The idea that, when someone dies, their soul lives on and does not leave this world, forced to watch the world and grieve. And the longer their stay, the stronger the pain.\r\n\r\nWhat monstrous thoughts could be going through the minds of the thousand-year-old phantoms? What would they do if given a physical body?",
